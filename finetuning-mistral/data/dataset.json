It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves."

            "text": "Question: How does supervised learning work?\nAnswer: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled training data. The algorithm is trained on a dataset where the correct output is already known, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships between inputs and outputs."

            "text": "Question: Explain what deep learning is.\nAnswer: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. It's particularly powerful for complex tasks like image and speech recognition."
